## About this data
Here we provide our dataset for multi-label hate speech and abusive language detection in the Indonesian Twitter. The main dataset can be seen at **re_dataset** with labels information as follows:
* **HS** : hate speech label;
* **Abusive** : abusive language label;
* **HS_Individual** : hate speech targeted to an individual;
* **HS_Group** : hate speech targeted to a group;
* **HS_Religion** : hate speech related to religion/creed;
* **HS_Race** : hate speech related to race/ethnicity;
* **HS_Physical** : hate speech related to physical/disability;
* **HS_Gender** : hate speech related to gender/sexual orientation;
* **HS_Gender** : hate related to other invective/slander;
* **HS_Weak** : weak hate speech;
* **HS_Moderate** : moderate hate speech;
* **HS_Strong** : strong hate speech.

For each label, `1` means `yes` (tweets including that label), `0` mean `no` (tweets are not included in that label). 

Due to Twitter's Terms of Service (now X), we do not provide the hydrated tweet (unfortunately, we forget to store the tweet ID when we collect the data). All usernames and URLs in this dataset are changed into USER and URL. 

For text normalization in our experiment, we built typo and slang words dictionaries named **new_kamusalay.csv**, that contain two columns (first columns are the typo and slang words, and the second one is the formal words). Here the examples of mapping:
* *beud --> banget*
* *jgn --> jangan*
* *loe --> kamu*

Furthermore, we also built abusive lexicon list named **abusive.csv** that can be used for feature extraction.
